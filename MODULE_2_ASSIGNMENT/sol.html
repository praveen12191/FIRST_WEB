            <h4> May help treat kidney stones</h4>
            <p class="p1">Urinary stones are painful clumps of mineral crystal that form in the urinary system.

                The most common form is kidney stones, which form in the kidneys.
                
                There’s limited evidence that water intake can help prevent recurrence in people who have previously gotten kidney stones (22, 23).
                
                Higher fluid intake increases the volume of urine passing through the kidneys. This dilutes the concentration of minerals, so they’re less likely to crystallize and form clumps.
                
                Water may also help prevent the initial formation of stones, but studies are required to confirm this.</p>

            <h4> Helps prevent hangovers </h4>
            <p class="p2">A hangover refers to the unpleasant symptoms experienced after drinking alcohol.

                Alcohol is a diuretic, so it makes you lose more water than you take in. This can lead to dehydration (24, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).
                
                Although dehydration isn’t the main cause of hangovers, it can cause symptoms like thirst, fatigue, headache, and dry mouth.
                
                Good ways to reduce hangovers are to drink a glass of water between drinks and have at least one big glass of water before going to bed.</p>

            <h4> Can aid weight loss</h4>
            <p class="p3">Drinking plenty of water can help you lose weight.

                This is because water can increase satiety and boost your metabolic rate.
                
                Some evidence suggests that increasing water intake can promote weight loss by slightly increasing your metabolism, which can increase the number of calories you burn on a daily basis.
                
                A 2013 study in 50 young women with overweight demonstrated that drinking an additional 16.9 ounces (500 mL) of water 3 times per day before meals for 8 weeks led to significant reductions in body weight and body fat compared with their pre-study measurements </p>
